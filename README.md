# BlackBoysCode_JS_Session
A collection of code examples for a coding class I teach every other month. This particular one is for JavaScript Fundamentals.
Students learn about planning and design ("Program recipes"), syntax & comments, instructions (commands & functions), memory (variables & collections) and logic (conditionals and operators). 

This project includes 4 different simple web exercises designed to help students understand the basics of programming:
1. Syntax Basics
2. Operators (Calculator App)
3. Conditionals (Which is bigger?)
4. Random Numbers (Rock Paper Scissors App).

There are some obvious bugs and areas of improvement placed in each exercise so that students can learn by
analysing the code based on what they have learned, fixing bugs and improving the UI and logic.
